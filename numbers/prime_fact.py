# Prime Factorization
# Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any)
# and display them.

# Step 1: Start by dividing the number by the first prime number 2 and continue
# dividing by 2 until you get a decimal or remainder. Then divide by 3, 5, 7,
# etc. until the only numbers left are prime numbers.

# Step 2: Write the number as a product of prime numbers.
# (228 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 19)
